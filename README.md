## Project Idea
One of UN’s sustainable development agenda is to eradicate hunger and end poverty by the year 2030.

Statics show that about 8.9% or 690 million people starve due to lack of resources to afford food.

It is also imperative to note that the world population is gradually increasing , and is expected to grow upto 8.7 billion in 2030.

It is possible to end eradicate hunger through technology.
A lot of food produced goes into waste due to short shelf life, poor preservation methods, poor storage infrastructure, e.t.c.
Food from grocery stores & supermarkets, restaurants and households, majorly end up in bins, despite rampant starvation.

>SOLUTION

To solve the aforeseen food wastage, and translatively ensure its accessibility to those in need, we shall create a web app, where vendors(Abundance), can interact with local beneficiaries for a seamless give where appreciated transaction with ultimate benevolence. 

## Interface
---
 
 The web page will provide a section for interested parties to log in, provide info such as their location to be connected to food providers around their area, and the number of people in the household who need the food to control the ration.
The food order will then be logged in and an order receipt sent to the beneficiary’s phone and food pick up or delivery arranged thereafter.
